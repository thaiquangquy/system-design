## [rate-limiter](rate-limiter/README.md): 
- A rate limiter service that implements the Sliding Window Counter algorithm, backed by Redis. It exposes a fast, unauthenticated endpoint to check/consume rate-limit quota for a key, and an admin-authenticated CRUD API to manage the rules that define limits per key prefix.
- Built with Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.3.
